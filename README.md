# cs2mqtt

## Introduction

This project allows you to integrate your [Counter-Strike 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_2/) game with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) by exposing it as an [MQTT device](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/).
Its purpose is to enable you to automate your smart home based on in-game events and information, enhancing your overall gaming experience.

**cs2mqtt** is cross-platform and can run locally on your gaming machine or any server device.

## Architecture
**cs2mqtt** receives its data from the built-in [Counter-Strike Game State Integration](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive_Game_State_Integration) engine. This integration is created by Valve and is safe to use and will not be flagged by anti-cheat systems such as [VAC](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/571A-97DA-70E9-FF74) or [FACEIT](https://www.faceit.com/en/anti-cheat).

    HA(Home Assistant
     MQTT integration)

     CS2 -- Game state data in JSON format over HTTP(s) --> C2M
     C2M -- MQTT messages --> MQTT(MQTT broker)
     MQTT --> HA
```

Internally, **cs2mqtt** keeps track of the current state of every connected Counter-Strike game instance.
Inside the Counter-Strike game, every game state change will trigger the game to send a full payload containing both the changed and unchanged state data.
**cs2mqtt** compares the received data to its in-memory cache, updates the cache accordingly, and asynchronously submits the changed data as MQTT messages to the MQTT broker.

    GameStateService -- Push new data to observer --> AvailabilityMqttPublisher
    GameStateService -- Push new data to observer --> GameStateMqttPublisher
    GameStateService -- Push new data to observer --> HomeAssistantDevicePublisher

    AvailabilityMqttPublisher -- Maintain availability (online/offline) for every sensor ---> MqttClient
    GameStateMqttPublisher -- Send game state data on distinct sensor topics ---> MqttClient
    HomeAssistantDevicePublisher -- Use Home Assistant MQTT device discovery protocol to automatically create Home Assistant devices and sensors for each data provider. ---> MqttClient
```

## Counter-Strike as a Home Assistant MQTT device
If the [MQTT integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/) is installed, **cs2mqtt** will automatically create MQTT devices using the [MQTT Discovery protocol](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/#mqtt-discovery), with all values configured as [sensors](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/sensor.mqtt/).

### System availability
On startup, when **cs2mqtt** connects to the MQTT broker, it publishes an `online` message to `cs2mqtt/status`.
It also sets a Last Will and Testament (LWT) for the MQTT broker to publish an `offline` message to this topic if it loses connection or terminates unexpectedly.
On graceful shutdown, **cs2mqtt** will publish an offline message to this topic before disconnecting.

### Device availability
When a Counter-Strike 2 game instance submits data for the first time, **cs2mqtt** will automatically create an MQTT device for it, as described above, and publish online messages to `cs2mqtt/{steamId64}/+/status` topics.
If a player disconnects from a game server, the topics related to `player_state`, `map`, and `round` will immediately be set to `offline`.
When a player closes their Counter-Strike 2 game, there is no data transmitted, and there's nothing to indicate they've quit. As a result, **cs2mqtt** listens for heartbeats and eventually sets the entire device to an offline availability state once the timeout is reached.

## Running **cs2mqtt** with Docker Compose

In this example, it is expected that an MQTT broker, such as [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/), is already set up and configured with the [MQTT integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/) in [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).

### docker-compose.yml

```yaml
services:
  cs2mqtt:
    image: ghcr.io/lupusbytes/cs2mqtt:latest
    container_name: cs2mqtt
    ports:
      - "5000:8080"
    environment:
      MQTT__Host: 127.0.0.1         # MQTT broker address
      MQTT__Port: 1883              # MQTT broker port
      MQTT__UseTLS: false           # Set to true if your broker uses TLS (optional, default: false)
      MQTT__Username: c2m           # MQTT client username (optional)
      MQTT__Password: password      # MQTT client password (optional)
      MQTT__ClientId: cs2mqtt       # MQTT client ID (optional)
      MQTT__ProtocolVersion: 5.0.0  # Allowed values are 3.1.0, 3.1.1, or 5.0.0 (optional, default: 5.0.0)
      
    restart: unless-stopped
```
 
>‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure you replace the host, username, and password with values matching your setup, and that the MQTT client is not also used by another application.  
If the broker is configured to allow anonymous access, the username and password can be omitted.

## Running **cs2mqtt** as Home Assistant Add-On

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the add add-on repository dialog with a specific repository URL pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Flupusbytes%2Fcs2mqtt)

Add this repo as an add-on repository via the button above or manually by going to the Add-On Store, clicking on the top right hamburger menu, selecting Repositories and adding `https://github.com/lupusbytes/cs2mqtt`.

Configure the addon just like you would for docker compose. Follow the step below to add the gamestate config to your CS2 directory but make sure to replace the `uri` with your HomeAssistant server IP and the port you configured.

### Connecting **Counter-Strike 2** to **cs2mqtt**

To make **Counter-Strike 2** send game state data to **cs2mqtt**, you need to create a config file within the game's directory.

If **Steam** and **Counter-Strike 2** are installed with default options, the path where you need to create your config is:

```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\cfg
```

Once you have located the correct path, create a new file there called **gamestate_integration_cs2mqtt.cfg** with the following content:

```
"cs2mqtt"
{
 "uri" "http://127.0.0.1:5000"
 "timeout" "5.0"
 "buffer"  "0.1"
 "throttle" "0.1"
 "heartbeat" "5.0"
 "data"
 {
   "provider"            "1" 
   "map"                 "1"      
   "round"               "1"
   "player_id"           "1"
   "player_state"        "1"
 }
}
```

> üí° Tip
>
>In Windows File Explorer, it can be tricky to create a new file with a specific file extension (like `.cfg`).  
A simple workaround is to copy one of the many pre-existing `.cfg` files in the folder, rename it, and then replace its contents using Notepad.

>‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure you replace the `uri` with the IP address or hostname of the host that is running **cs2mqtt**.

The next time you launch **Counter-Strike 2**, **cs2mqtt** will use the [MQTT discovery protocol](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/#mqtt-discovery) to make [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) create an MQTT device named `CS2 STEAM_{X}:{Y}:{Z}`, matching your SteamID. On the very first game launch, the device will not have many sensors, but after joining or creating a game server, all sensors will automatically be discovered.

### Additional configuration options

It is possible to require authentication between **Counter-Strike 2** and **cs2mqtt**.  
To do this, pick a password and add it as an environment variable in the **cs2mqtt** docker-compose.yml like:

```yaml
GameStateOptions__Token: password
```

Then also add the same password to **gamestate_integration_cs2mqtt.cfg** in the root object:

```
"auth"
{
  "token" "password"
}
```

### 

### Limiting what game state data is sent

It is possible to remove any of the following entries from the data object in **gamestate_integration_cs2mqtt.cfg**:  
- `map`
- `round`
- `player_id`
- `player_state`

This will stop **Counter-Strike 2** from sending data about the removed topics.  
The only required entry is `provider`.
